# Contact Database

This is my first full stack project. The purpose of this project is to save various contacts and can display where they live depending on their addresses. I used various kinds of technology: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Google Map API, Node.js, Express and MySQL.

## Login page
This is the login page before you access to the contact page. When the submit button is clikced, an AJAX request containing the values entered for "User" and "Password" are sent to the server for user credentials validataion before allowing further access to the website.

## Contacts page - Edit Contact Functionality
In this page, you can add, update, edit and delete the contacts. If the user does not enter valid input into all input fields, the error message would be displayed and it would not let you add more contacts.

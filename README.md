# Contact Database

This is my first full stack project. The purpose of this project is to save various contacts and can display where they live depending on their addresses. I used various kinds of technology: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Google Map API, Node.js, Express and MySQL.

## Contacts page - Edit Contact Functionality
In this page, you can update, edit and delete the contacts.
